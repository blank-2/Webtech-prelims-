       <p>What is Death Penalty? <br>Death Penalty, also known as Capital Punishment is a penalty where in the person subjected will be receiving put 
            to death by a state as the persons punishment for the crime done. </p>
       <p>As we wander at Mines view park, we saw a lot of tarpaulins and posters that promotes human rights and one of them is 
      "No to death penalty, yes to life!". The program is being supported by the mines view barangay to promote fair justice. We all 
      do not want risking innocent people being excuted for the crime they didn't commit and this also does not give the person the chance to change
       and atone for his sins</p>

       <p>In Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, It stated that "Everyone has the human right to work, to just conditions of work, to protection against
         unemployment, to equal pay for equal work, to sufficient pay to ensure a dignified"
         existence for one's self and one's family, and the human right to join a trade union.</p><br>
       <p>In this part, Mines View Barangay did it right! We interviewed some of the vendors and we're happy to hear that they are
          receiving the minimum wage of 300 pesos in Baguio City. The Right to work, does not mean that every one is entittled to a job unconditionally, but this
          right gives the state a responsibility to eliminate unemployment ang to obtain jobs that are under favourable circumstances for the employee.
