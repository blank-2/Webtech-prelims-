                <p>We have to dispose of these traditional men and women roles, the possibility of a strong and weak gender, and rather make the most of our hereditary contrasts, respect each other for our unique identities and differences and give each other all the freedom to develop our skills and succeed. When we are given an opportunity, we should take that opportunity with no limits to others otherwise, we will never make a better world to live in. Equal opportunities correspond to respecting individuals and all of us have the same opportunity to satisfy our dreams in life. Furthermore, we can find a sense of contentment within ourselves.</p>
